### Single-mode approximation

---

**p. 4, paragraph 1, line 1**

*Rewritten*:

"In Eqs. (1)-(3), we take into account several hundred of the Bloch modes of the plasmonic structure, which together form the EM field distribution in the active medium. Numerical simulations show that this distribution does not change in the first and second stages of the system response."

**p. 6, paragraph 2, line 10**

*Add* after "â€¦$\gamma_a \simeq 10^{12} \text{s}^{-1}$":

"Note that the finite size of the pump beam can lead to the appearance of edge effects and influence on the mode quality factor, see [21]. In the single-mode model, we do not take into account these effects for simplicity. We will further see that this simple model is in good agreement with the numerical simulations of Eqs. (1)-(3)."
