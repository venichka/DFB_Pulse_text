---

**p. 2, paragraph 5, line 11**

*Changed*:

"We demonstrate that there is an optimal size of the pump beam, for which the response time reaches
a minimum. For typical experimental parameters, the optimal size of the pump beam is ∼ 15μm and the minimal response time is ∼ 1 ps. The obtained value of the response time is in agreement with a recent experiment [1] where it has been shown that plasmonic lasers have a modulation frequency exceeding several hundred GHz in the large-signal modulation regime. Thus, the optimization of the pump beam size makes it possible to increase the modulation speed as well as the energy efficiency of plasmonic DFB laser devices." 

*to*

"Consequently, there is the diameter of the pump beam, $d_{\text{beam}}^*$, necessary to achieve the short response time. This diameter is about the decay length of the EM field in the plasmonic structure and for the plasmonic laser under consideration is $\sim 15 \mu$m. When the size of the pump beam is greater than $d_{\text{beam}}^*$, the response time of the plasmonic laser is $\sim 1$ $\text{ps}​$. The obtained results confirm that plasmonic DFB lasers can have a modulation frequency exceeding several hundred GHz in the large-signal modulation regime. 
Optimization of the size of the pump beam allows an increase in the modulation speed, as well as the energy efficiency of plasmonic DFB laser devices."

---

**p. 4, paragraph 1, line 3**

*Add* after "...see Fig. 3.":

"Although in our simulations we take into account several hundred of the Bloch modes of the plasmonic structure, which together form the EM field distribution in the active medium, we can see that the EM field distribution practically does not change in the first and second stages of the system response. In other words, there is a dynamical balance between relaxation processes in the plasmonic structure, the propagation of the EM field outside the pumped area and the stimulated amplification of the EM field inside the pumped area."

**p. 4, paragraph 1, line 7**

*Deleted*:

"The time independence of the EM field distribution allows us to consider the plasmonic laser as a single mode laser."

------

**p. 4, paragraph 2, line 1**

*Change*:

"Based on this observation, we assume that the part of the active medium pumped by an external beam effectively excites a single collective mode, which is formed by the Bloch modes of the plasmonic structure. In this case, the system dynamics can be approximately described by the following system of equations [5]:"

*to*

"We use the fact of the constancy of the EM field distribution to construct a single-mode model. To do this, we assume that there is a single collective mode, the EM field distribution of which coincides with the EM field distribution found in the numerical simulations of the multimode problem. Furthermore, we assume that the pumped active medium interacts only with such a single collective mode. Within these approximations, the system dynamics can be approximately described by the following system of equations [5]:"

Distribution of the EM field intensity on the surface of the plasmonic DFB laser when the diameter of the pump beam $d_{\text{beam}}>d_{\text{beam}}^*$ (d)-(f) in time moment 0.32 ps (d); 0.541 ps (e); 1.5 ps (f).

### Conclusion

*Changed*:

"such a laser for typical experimental parameters"

*to*

---

**p. 7, paragraph 2, line 8**

*Added*:

"It is interesting to note that the delay time, Eq.~(\ref{tdel}), resembles the dependence of the delay time of a superradiant burst [24-26]. Indeed, it is well known [24, 25] that a system consisting of initially inverted atoms placed in a low-Q cavity, i.e., when $\gamma_a \gg \gamma_D$, exhibits a superradiant burst with the delay time, Eq. (15). In the plasmonic cavity, the inequality $\gamma_a \gg \gamma_D$ is always hold true and, for this reason, the superradiance problem and the problem that we investigate here have the same physical grounds. Further study of the relationship between these problems may be important in the context of creating ultrafast optoelectronic devices."
